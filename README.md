# Calculator
This calculator application offers a dual approach to meet different user needs:
1. User-Centric Approach: The calculator adapts based on the user's age group:

10-20 Years: Provides a basic calculator with simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and a clean, straightforward interface.
Over 20 Years: Offers a scientific calculator with advanced functions including trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, exponentials, square roots, and more complex expressions.


2. System-Centric Approach: The application balances functionality with optimized code:
Dynamically generates the appropriate interface based on user selection
Efficiently handles calculations using Python's math library
Provides proper error handling for invalid expressions
Uses Tkinter for a lightweight, cross-platform GUI



The calculator features a clean display area, intuitive button layout, and clear functionality. Users first select their age group via radio buttons, which then displays the appropriate calculator interface tailored to their expected needs and expertise level.
